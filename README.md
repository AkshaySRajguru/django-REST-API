# django-REST-API
# * Web Application Program Interface:
## Contract provided by one piece of software to another
## Structured request and response
### Analogy: API is just like a waiter in a hotel
#
# * REST: REpresentational State Transfer
## It is an arcitecture style for designing networked applications
## Relies on stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP
## Treats server objects as resources which can be created or destroyed
### Basically API is the messanger and REST lets us use HTTP requests to format those messages.
